MultiStateTMLE is a framework for nonparametric causal inference with
multistate event processes, built around stochastic intensity
interventions, calibrated interventions, and composite estimands, and
estimated using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) allowing
flexible nuisance learning.
